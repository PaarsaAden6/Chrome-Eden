    <p>
      Chrome Eden is a Y2K-inspired jewelry concept created as a first semester
      web development project. The design combines dark chrome elements with soft
      pink tones to reflect early 2000s aesthetics.

      This website was built using basic HTML and CSS to demonstrate layout,
      styling, and visual design while keeping the structure simple and user-friendly.
      While making this website i kept in mind that even though it is my student project it should be user friendly and it was a really fun experience for me (^.^) and i wanted it to be fun for others as well.
